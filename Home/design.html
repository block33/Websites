                <h2>WHAT IS ORB</h2>
                <img/>
                <p>Orb is a small organization that consists of a few members who work on different projects. Mainly, we started off trying to build one thing however, because the ones amongst us had different projects, we decided to put them on one website. This allows us to regroup all of our projects in one place but different sections. So different applications will have a different design to represent the idea behind it. </p>

                <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
                <img/>
                <p>Our objectives are mainly to explore to world of technology. We're touching mostly everything, either web design (which was made from scratch), or software development, game developement, or event mechanical development. We don't want a website that specifies in one thing because we love diversity so our idea is basically to satisfy the people around us while we hopefully learn at the same time. We enjoy gathering knowledge and apply them in reality with the appropriate perspective..</p>

                <h2>WHY?</h2>
                <img/>
                <p>The big question for us. Why we decided to create Orb. There are several website that allows you to host projects and have communities where people help others to build their projects for sake of interest in the clientel. However, I think we mostly decided to merge all projects inro Orb because it's just easier to regroup the teamwork of all our members. Not only it helps me but anybody who wants a place on the website can join, we will deliberatly have a project section made specifically for you. But do not get confused, Orb is not exactly a project hoster. it's just a way to advertise what we enjoy doing: learning. </p>
